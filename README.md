### Qualifications summary
* I'm passionate about network-facing problems and it is what I do since I entered on my university.
* I'm a free software fan and I use ArchLinux as my main system.
* I love performance and I'm used to favor languages built on the zero-overhead principle.

### GitHub Projects
* [vinipsmaker/tufao](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/tufao) : Asynchronous web framework for C++ built on top of Qt.
    - Project started in 2011 and still maintained.
    - 170 stars on GitHub.
    - 19 users on the mailing list and usually 4 users online on IRC.
    - Inspired by _Node.js_.
    - C++, but cross-platform.
    - Great documentation (reference, tutorial, examples, QtCreator plugin to speedup...).
    - Very flexible.
    - I made a talk on Tufão for one of the largest free software events in Brazil -- FISL.
    - It gave me great experience on how to coordinate collaboration with possible contributors, how to encourage positive feedback, run a free software project...
* [BoostGSoC14/boost.http](http://github.com/BoostGSoC14/boost.http) : This library can be used to create applications that need to expose services through HTTP (e.g. embeddable ReST services).
    - Developed as part of a [GSoC 2014 project](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/vinipsmaker/5835889892655104) (somehow easier than my previous GSoC project).
    - [Scheduled for review to be accepted into Boost high quality C++ libraries](http://www.boost.org/community/review_schedule.html) (but I'm very confident). If accepted, it'll have a great impact on how C++ programmers code HTTP services, given that ASIO is expected to become the future C++ standard for sockets.
    - Many many tests and yet more tests being implemented.
    - CI for test under GNU/Linux and an ongoing effort to add Visual Studio-based CI support.
    - It caused me a great change of perspective on how to think about asynchronous code.
    - It was a great project to develop the skill on how to elaborate good design.
    - Finally the opportunity to justifiably use some cool C++ tricks.
* [vinipsmaker/tamanduang](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/tamanduang) : a compiler class&#39; assignment
    - My first Rust code.
    - A lexer for a shitty language that I'm designing.
* [vinipsmaker/tufao-qtcreatorplugin](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/tufao-qtcreatorplugin) : plugin for QtCreator IDE to easily create new Tufão projects
    - It gave me experience on how to work with mysterious APIs that are half-baked, underdocumented and break API every release.
    - Fair enough, it's a very small project.
* [vinipsmaker/logica-whopper](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/logica-whopper) : Just a logic class&#39; assignment.
    - Simple Python program that evaluate some simple logic expressions.
    - [Watch the asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/7839).
* [vinipsmaker/drunken-octo-sansa](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/drunken-octo-sansa) : Random code to solve random problems
    - Code created while I was training to compete on the ACM-ICPC.
* [vinipsmaker/c-except](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/c-except) : An exception system for C in a single header file
    - Just an experiment to see how I'd implement an exception system for the C language.
* [vinipsmaker/dotfiles](http://github.com/vinipsmaker/dotfiles) : Config files for my ArchLinux system

### Other Personal Projects
* [libdepixelize](https://launchpad.net/libdepixelize)  &raquo; Implementation for the Kopf/Lischinski vectorization algorithm for depixelation of non-blended non-anti-aliased pixel art.
    - Developed as part of a [GSoC 2013 project](https://vinipsmaker.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/gsoc2013-inkscape/).
    - It was a great challenge to do research, learn from research (mostly documents that aren't teaching oriented and aren't easily indexed), play with math and implement an algorithm for which I found no alternative implementation that I could use for reference.
    - Gave me a taste of how awesome the Inkscape community is.
    - The opportunity to make improvements&#91;[1](https://vinipsmaker.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/should-i-really-target-kopf-lischinski/)&#93;&#91;[2](https://plus.google.com/118295250366112843114/posts/84tLGpMFRe5)&#93;&#91;[3](https://vinipsmaker.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/another-libdepixelize-update/)&#93;&#91;[4](https://plus.google.com/118295250366112843114/posts/WXEWKtyetEN)&#93; to an algorithm that were already awesome.
    - The opportunity to work with really smart people (I cannot express how much I enjoyed the experience).
    - [Used in Inkscape to vectorize pixel art](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/0.91#Trace_Pixel_Art_.28libdepixelize.29).
